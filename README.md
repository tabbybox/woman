## Quick start

The deal is simple, wrap your main code inside a function, say the main() function as how any other language had it, and delegate it to your "supposedly" beloved one.
```js
import { Woman } from '@tabbybox/woman';

function main(){
    // Your code runs here
    // Hi mom
    console.log("Goodbye world")

    /* Your long running function that can't affort crashing start here */
}

const gf = new Woman();

// Delegate your main function because she is important to you.
gf.deligate(main)

```

Congratulations, you have done setting up one big horrible grenade for yourself. Sit back and enjoy the moment when disaster unfolds upon your past mistakes along your Git commit history.
